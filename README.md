webrtc crypto currency
The simple test of web currency.

The First Step:

Use webgl to calculate hashes for cryptocurrency

I use old code for bitcoin and webgl with a little innovation.

File clientclass.js use websocket for receive informations for start cacluation of hash for bitcoin block ( by webgl ) - it is very slow method but in a few next steps you will know that is enough. Websocket will be changed for webrtc to send data between nodes.
